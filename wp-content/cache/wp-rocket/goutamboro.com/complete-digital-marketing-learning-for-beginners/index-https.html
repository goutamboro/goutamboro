Marketing?</h2><p>Digital marketing is all marketing efforts that utilize electronic or internet tools. All digital strategies and marketing channels used to stay connected with consumers online are the definitions of digital marketing. Websites, social media marketing, PPC advertising, email marketing, and SEO also included in digital marketing. &nbsp;</p><h2>Difference between Digital Marketing and Traditional Marketing</h2><p>&nbsp; Both of them are equally aiming to market. Marketing aims to introduce a product to the public or potential customers using a variety of strategies. The ultimate goal is to lure potential customers into using marketed products and maximizing your business marketing funnel. So not only focus on the introduction but also how to choose the right strategy to attract potential customers. To better understand the differences between digital marketing and ordinary marketing, here are some differences divided into three categories.</p><h3>1. <strong>Target Marketing</strong></h3><p>There are several marketing media that we have known for a long time. We usually get advertisements on television and radio. When on the way we are accustomed to seeing billboards. While reading the newspaper, we encountered several advertisements. Some of the examples above are traditional marketing that targets people in certain areas.</p><p>Unlike traditional marketing, digital marketing has a large marketing target. Not just one area, you can have national and even international marketing targets. By utilizing the internet as a marketing medium, the reach gained from digital marketing is more wide open. Anyone who uses the internet can be your marketing target.</p><h3>2. Time and Cost</h3><p>Traditional marketing takes a lot of time and money. Why is that? As you know, the process used to take care of advertisements is very complicated, sometimes it has to wait for a queue or when advertising is already used by other advertisers. In terms of the costs incurred are quite large, and you have to incur additional charges to produce your ad. &nbsp;</p><p>Unlike traditional marketing, through digital marketing, the process of making ads faster. You can determine when to advertise, how long you advertise without waiting in line, and the creation process&#8217;s completion in a short time. You can also set your ad budget and determine your ad&#8217;s reach. With digital marketing, everything can be done effectively and efficiently.</p><h3>3. Ways of Communication</h3><p>Interactions that occur in traditional marketing are only one-way. For example, if you advertise on one of the national television channels, someone who is watching your ad on television cannot respond to your ad. Bagitu also with marketing media such as newspapers, radio, billboards, and other traditional marketing media. &nbsp; What happens is that you offer products to many people without knowing what the reactions and responses of people who see your ad. Are they interested? Are they happy? Do they like it? You will never know.</p><p>That is why digital marketing is said to be an effective and efficient marketing method. You can determine the response of people who saw your ad. If the results are not satisfactory, you can see what weaknesses your ads have to fix and remarket to get satisfying results. &nbsp;</p><h2>Why Implement Digital Marketing?</h2><p>&nbsp; In the beginning, I mentioned a little that the majority of India&#8217;s population is connected to the internet, and this is an opportunity that should not be missed by all business owners. Apart from that, there are several other reasons why you should utilize digital marketing.&nbsp; &nbsp; Here are six main reasons why digital marketing is important for your business: &nbsp;</p><h3>1. Provide Equal Opportunities for All Businesses</h3><p>Digital marketing allows all business scales to dive into it, be it large companies, medium businesses, or small businesses. Even digital marketing can be applied by business owners who are just starting out. &nbsp; All business scales can take advantage of digital marketing because the tools needed for digital marketing are readily available to anyone. Armed with a laptop and an internet connection, you can apply digital marketing, from content marketing to social media marketing. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3>2. Cheaper and most Effective than Traditional Marketing</h3><p>Besides not requiring complicated tools, digital marketing is also relatively less expensive compared to traditional marketing. Small and medium businesses that implement digital marketing can save up to 40 percent of marketing budgets.</p><p>Not only economical, but digital marketing also produces better performance than traditional marketing. Gartner&#8217;s survey also shows that 28 percent of small and medium businesses are planning to move conventional marketing allocations to digital marketing. This move shows that digital marketing is more effective than traditional marketing. &nbsp;</p><h3>3. Increase of Revenue</h3><p>Increase Revenue Effectively With more effective marketing methods, you can also increase revenue more effectively. Based on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.enterpriseinnovation.net/article/big-benefits-seen-small-businesses-online-strategies-1898154319?qt-knowledge_central=0" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;report, businesses that utilize digital marketing have managed to increase revenue by 2.8 more than businesses that only rely on traditional marketing. &nbsp;</p><p>4. Lets You Connect with Specific Audiences One of the most important reasons you should immediately switch to digital marketing is to target a specific audience. Digital marketing can collect a variety of essential data, from location, age, interests, to gender, to determine the most appropriate target for your marketing campaign. &nbsp;</p><p>5. More Effective for Mobile Device Users Based on Google research,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/trends-and-insights/year-in-search-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">94 percent</a>&nbsp;of Indonesian internet users access the internet through mobile devices. The majority of Indonesian internet users access the internet through smartphones because it&#8217;s easier and faster to access. With the help of digital marketing, you can reach consumers through mobile devices, especially social media. &nbsp;</p><p>6. Building a Brand Reputation Business reputation in cyberspace is very important in this digital era. Digital marketing helps you build a good reputation through websites, social media, to SEO. According to Adweek&#8217;s research, 81 percent of consumers conduct online research before making a purchase. It applies both for online and offline purchases. According to Forbes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnellett/2018/02/08/new-research-shows-growing-impact-of-online-research-on-in-store-purchases/#3c75c16616a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">82 percent of</a>&nbsp;consumers do online research at a physical store just before buying goods at the store. Therefore, your existence in cyberspace is significant, and you can achieve it with digital marketing.</p><h2>Digital Marketing Strategy</h2><p>&nbsp; All business owners inevitably have to keep up with the times, including you. One way is to use digital marketing. What strategies do you need to apply to your digital marketing? Here&#8217;s the full explanation: &nbsp;</p><h3>1. SEO</h3><p>Search Engine Optimization or more often called SEO, is an attempt to optimize your Website so that it is more easily found in search results. Search results on Google are the primary source of traffic for most websites. Your Website can be more easily found in Google&#8217;s search results by applying SEO techniques. There are 2 SEO techniques, SEO On Page, and Off-Page SEO. &nbsp; However, it must also be understood that it takes quite a long time to get results from SEO. So you have to be patient and diligent in applying SEO techniques. &nbsp;</p><h3>2. Content Marketing</h3><p>Content marketing is a marketing technique that involves creating and distributing relevant, important, and consistent content to attract audiences with the aim of converting them into consumers. Content created and distributed in content marketing is not arbitrary content. There are two important elements of content marketing.</p><p>First, the content must meet these three conditions: important, relevant, and consistent. So, you cannot be careless in creating content for content marketing. Content must meet the three requirements above. You must create content that is relevant to your business. For example, you manage a fashion business. Then you need to make content related to fashion. Relevant is not enough. You also need to consider whether the content is valuable or not for the target audience to know. Make a priority scale containing topics relevant to the target audience. &nbsp;</p><h3>3. Social Media Marketing</h3><p>Social media marketing is the activity of promoting products or services on social media platforms using specific strategies. The definition is indeed quite simple, namely promoting products or services on social media. However, the real core of social media marketing lies in its strategy. You can&#8217;t just create your business account on social media and then create content without a strategy. Research is needed to determine which social media channels are most suitable for your business. You need to set clear goals and metrics to measure the success of your social media marketing strategy. &nbsp;</p><h3>4. Pay Per Click</h3><p>PPC is short for Pay Per Click, an internet marketing model in which advertisers only need to pay for every ad that is clicked by the target audience. This advertising system is commonly used by large companies such as Google, Facebook, and Instagram. Pay per click is an ad model suitable for use today, considering that the majority of India&#8217;s population is connected to the internet. Also, this advertising model is more effective, efficient, and economical than conventional advertising models. There are various options for creating PPC ads, from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, to Instagram Ads. &nbsp;</p><h3>5. Affiliate Marketing</h3><p>Affiliate programs or affiliate marketing is not a stranger in the world of marketing. There are already many companies both from abroad and within the country that provide affiliate programs. Amazon, eBay, and Rakuten are several companies providing affiliate programs from abroad. Many Indian companies also offer affiliate programs with various commissions.</p><p>With affiliate marketing, you can invite regular customers to advertise your products to their friends or followers on social media. Niagahoster also implemented this marketing strategy and successfully attracted more than 1400 people to promote Niagahoster products such as&nbsp;<strong>cheap free domain hosting promos</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>VPS Hosting</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Cloud Hosting</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Email Hosting</strong>. You can also implement affiliate marketing in a business that you manage. &nbsp;</p><p>5. Email Marketing Email marketing is sending commercial messages such as newsletters and promotions via email.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/spam" target="_blank">Gary Thuerk</a>&nbsp;was the first person to send email marketing in 1978. Since then, email has been known as one of the effective marketing tools. In 2017, out of 205 billion emails sent every day,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Email-Statistics-Report-2015-2019-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank">120 billion of</a>&nbsp;them are business emails, including email marketing. Some people might consider email marketing as spam, which has the potential to interfere with consumers. However, the facts say otherwise, the use of email marketing continues to increase every year. &nbsp;</p><p>A study conducted by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/why-marketers-should-keep-sending-you-emails" target="_blank">McKinsey and Company</a>&nbsp;shows that email marketing is 40 times more effective at gaining consumers than Facebook and Twitter. This high effectiveness might be due to companies being able to reach consumers in their area, that is, email inboxes. Also,&nbsp;59 percent of consumers are&nbsp;willing to subscribe to email marketing or newsletters if an offer is given. These offers can be in the form of exclusive coupons or discounts.</p><p>According to research,&nbsp;65 percent of consumers&nbsp;get discount coupons from email marketing. This shows that email marketing encourages consumers to shop both online and directly to the store. &nbsp;</p><h3>6. Google My Business</h3><p>Google My Business is a feature for business owners that is useful for making it easier for potential customers to find out complete information about their business. Company names, company addresses, company telephone numbers, company email addresses, operating hours, company websites, office photos, and customer reviews.</p><p>By registering your business on Google My Business, your office, restaurant, or company automatically appears on Google Maps. Customers who want to come to your business will be easy to get to the location with the help of Google Maps. Although it looks trivial, Google My Business has many benefits. From businesses appearing on Google Maps, customer reviews, to communication media for customers.
